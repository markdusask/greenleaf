The aim of this assignment is to establish a forum for you to reflect upon personal biases that could impact your future practice.\n\nWhat is Reflective Learning?\nAccording to one definition it involves \"paying critical attention to the practical values and theories which inform everyday actions, by examining practice reflectively and reflexively. This leads to developmental insight\" (Bolton G. 2010)\n\nAnother definition states, \"Reflection is a metacognitive process that creates a greater understanding of both the self and the situation so that future actions can be informed by this understanding. Self- regulated and lifelong learning have reflection as an essential aspect, and it is also required to develop both a therapeutic relationship and professional expertise.\" (Sanders J. 2009)\n\nInstructions:\n\nPart I\n\n1.  Review the pre-reading and resources.\n\n2. Choose one statement from the following list, or a statement\/personal observation of your own as it relates to stigma to complete the reflection assignment.\n\n3.  Complete a one to two-page written reflection (approx. 500 words). Content should include:\n\na.  your opinion on the statement, as well as\n\nb.  a contrasting opinion\n\nc.  discuss how this specific statement, and bias, could affect your future training and practice\n\nd.  outline how you and\/or the health care system could mitigate bias and stigma as it pertains to mental health\n \n\n\nPart II\n\nYou will be divided into groups of ten and will access BBLearn where you will be able to upload your stigma reflection paper. You then must choose at least two other student reflections to provide comments and constructive feedback. It is encouraged to read all the reflections, to help you to gain a deeper understanding of various perceptions and opinions peers may hold.":"N\/A"},"2081357":{"01 Explain the role of stigma in mental health.":"N\/A"},"2081358":{"02 Given a patient\/patient or patient physician interaction identify the presence of stigma.":"N\/A"},"2081359":{"03 Explain the implications for mental health at the individual and population levels for physician roles and PFCC.":"N\/A"}}},"372697":{"itemname":"Mental Health: Assessment Submission Deadline - Stigma Assignment (Commentary)","type":"Session","starts_on":"2024-11-20","objectives":{"2081360":{"See objectives for Stigma Assignment Draft.":"N\/A"}}},"372701":{"itemname":"Mental Health: Classification and Phenomenology\/Mental Status Examination","type":"Lecture-RecUnknown","starts_on":"2024-11-01","objectives":{"2081361":{"1.
